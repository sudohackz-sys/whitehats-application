## Why I want to join WhiteHats
I want to join WhiteHats to learn cybersecurity, improve my hacking skills, and participate in CTFs. I am also interested to learn how attacks work and how to defend systems.

## Recent Cybersecurity Incident
Recently, I read about large-scale data breaches where hackers leaked millions of user records due to weak security and protection. This shows why strong security is important.
